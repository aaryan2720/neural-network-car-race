# Car Racing Simulation

![Cover Image](thumbnail.png)

This project is a car racing simulation that features both human-controlled and AI-driven cars. The simulation includes a mini-map, statistics for each car, and a collision handling system. The AI cars can learn from previous experiences, making the simulation more interesting and challenging.

## Features

- **Car Generation**: Generate multiple cars, both human-controlled and AI-driven.
- **Collision Detection**: Handle collisions with road borders effectively.
- **Mini-map**: A mini-map displays the position and orientation of the cars.
- **Statistics Panel**: Displays statistics for each car, including progress and finish times.
- **AI Learning**: The AI cars can learn from the best-performing car's brain, allowing for improved performance in subsequent races.
- **Responsive Design**: The canvas adjusts based on window size.
